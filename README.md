# Lighthouse Labs

This is a collection of the material I use for lectures at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/).

The content is divided into [`Breakouts`](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/LighthouseLabs/tree/master/Breakouts) and [`Lectures`](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/LighthouseLabs/tree/master/Lectures). `Breakouts` are short 1-hour lectures. `Lectures` are longer (typically 2-hour) lectures on broader topics. The repos contain things such as:

- Slides
- Detailed notes with short examples
- Links to extra resources
- Example code and projects for demo purposes

Everything is licensed under GPL 3.0, and I try to cite every resource I use. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!
